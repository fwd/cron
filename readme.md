> A NodeJS package to simplify runtime CRON jobs. A sexier setInterval, basically.

## Install

```sh
npm install fwd/cron
```

## Usage

```js

const cron = require('@fwd/cron')

cron(() => {
   // runs every 24 hours
}, 'every 24 hours')

cron(() => {
   // runs every 1 month, and immediately 
}, 'every 1 month', true)

```

## Parameters

```js

cron(function, interval, runImmediately)

````

## Natural Language Interval

This package uses [@fwd/time](https://github.com/fwd/time) to parse time intervals.
